*Microsoft*

I received my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (2018, co-supervised by [Prof. Tulika Mitra](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/) and [Prof. Li-Shiuan Peh](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~peh/)) and B.E. from Shandong University (2013), both in Computer Science. I worked as postdoc at Cornell University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory working on HW/SW co-design and NoC. I am currently working on the Brainwave project at Microsoft. My research interests include:
- Many-Core Architecture
- Hardware/Software Co-Design
- Reconfigurable Accelerator
- Network-on-Chip
