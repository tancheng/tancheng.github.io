*Google*

I am currently a software engineer at Google working on Edge TPU. I received my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (co-supervised by [Prof. Tulika Mitra](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/) and [Prof. Li-Shiuan Peh](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~peh/)) and B.E. from Shandong University, both in Computer Science. I was employed by Cornell University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Microsoft, working on [Network-on-Chip](https://github.com/cornell-brg/pymtl3-net), [HW/SW co-design](https://github.com/pnnl/OpenCGRA), and [Brainwave Machine Learning Accelerator/Compiler](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-brainwave), respectively. I have published papers and served as program committee in most of the top-tier architecture-related conferences. My research interests include:
- Machine Learning Compilation
- Many-Core Architecture
- Hardware/Software Co-Design
- Reconfigurable Accelerator
- Network-on-Chip

I dedicate to democratizing domain-specific reconfigurable acceleration, aiming at a push-button automated solution towards compilation, architecture design, and synthesis, given the domain-specific applications including machine learning. Most of my research works are open-source at [https://github.com/tancheng](https://github.com/tancheng). Let me know if you are interested!
